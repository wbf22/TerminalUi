To create a method in an abstract class that needs to be overridden in a subclass in Java, you need to do the following:

1. Declare the method in the abstract class using the 'abstract' keyword. This indicates that the method is abstract and must be implemented in the subclass.

2. Provide an implementation for the method in the subclass by using the 'override' keyword followed by the method signature.

Here's an example:

Abstract class:
```
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract void draw();
}
```

Subclass:
```
public class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class has an abstract method `draw()` that must be implemented in any subclass of `Shape`, such as the `Circle` class. The `Circle` class provides an implementation of the `draw()` method.
